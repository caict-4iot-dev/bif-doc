# proxy 可升级合约, 代理合约

Proxy里都是有关可升级合约和代理合约相关的功能

## beacon

### `BeaconProxy.sol`

`BeaconProxy`大部分逻辑跟Proxy一样, 不同就是implementation的地址是每次实时请求`beacon`合约得到的. 因此合约逻辑升级更为灵活.

## ERC1967

### `ERC1967Proxy.sol`

[ERC1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967) 规定了implementation地址的固定位置 `0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc (obtained as bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip1967.proxy.implementation')) - 1))`

### `TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol`

[这篇文章](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357)里提出了当前的Proxy机制可能存在的一个漏洞, 虽然个人感觉实际上这个漏洞不太可能被触发, OpenZeppelin还是给了一个解决方案.

* 代码

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @dev This contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable by an admin.
 *
 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector
 * clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the
 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two
 * things that go hand in hand:
 *
 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if
 * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.
 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the
 * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says
 * "admin cannot fallback to proxy target".
 *
 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing
 * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due
 * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.
 *
 * Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,
 * you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.

## utils

### `Initializable.sol`

有关合约的作用其实在代码注释里已经说得很明确了, 因为Proxy Contract不会使用Constructor(因为数据不存在代理合约内), 需要部署后, 再通过源合约调用`Initialize`, 因此需要机制确保`Initialize`只会调用一次.

该合约给了一个基本实现方案.

* 代码

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// OpenZeppelin Contracts (last updated v4.5.0) (proxy/utils/Initializable.sol)

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "../../utils/Address.sol";

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *

## `Proxy.sol`

`Proxy`合约可以设置一个implementation地址, 用来保存执行逻辑, 但是合约的所有数据均保存在本合约内, 通过`fallback`机制, 将到合约的所有调用, 都转成对implementation地址的delegatecall.

这样通过更新implementation地址, 可以实现合约的执行逻辑升级, 同时因为数据始终在源合约内, 保持了数据的升级前后一致性.
